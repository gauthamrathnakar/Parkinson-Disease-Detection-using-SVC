## About Parkinson Disease
Parkinson's disease is a stealthy thief, a neurodegenerative disorder that slowly robs the brain of dopamine, a chemical crucial for movement. Tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement) emerge gradually, making daily tasks a challenge. There's no cure, but medication and therapies can help manage symptoms and empower patients to live full lives. Research strives to slow the disease's progression, offering hope for a future where Parkinson's doesn't steal control.
